# Task 2. Balanced Search Tree

Implement a generic BST (i.e. AVL, Cartesian tree, Splay). Using it, implement interfaces:
- Map 
- Mutable map
- List: `subList()` can be __skipped__ or implemented via creating a separate tree, there are no tests for it
- Bonus: Mutable list (you should write tests yourself)

##  Implementation details

Below are _mostly recommendations_ on how to solve the task. It is okay if you approach the task in a different way.

### Access to your implementation

There are several interfaces you have to implement. Tests work with instances of interfaces, not specific classes, via methods declared in `HelperFunctions.kt`. Like `listOf(1, 2)` provides you with `List<Int>`, while under the hood `ArrayList<Int>` (or some other implementation class) is used. You should replace TODOs in `HelperFunctions.kt` with code that returns your implementations.

### Architecture and Inheritance

We expect you to write some BST as a base class that implements the first interface from `Task.kt` file. Apart from methods in the interface, it should have core functionality of a BST: add and remove nodes in log(n) time. Notice that second type parameter `V`, which is the type of values, is not `Comparable`, hence `maximum/minimumValue` returns not the actual maximum or minimum, but the value which is assigned to `maximum/minimumKey` respectively.

Most likely, you will need a separate `Node` class. 

When you have a working BST, you can use it to implement other interfaces. `MutableMap` and `Map` share most of their code, so it is easier to only implement the mutable version and typecast it to read-only when needed.

You can make `List` and `Map` completely separate, or one can be inherited from the other, do what you find more comfortable.

__Note:__ `detekt` limits number of methods in a class. Please implement each interface separately whenever possible, instead of creating a single almighty class.

### Access modifiers

Throughout your solution pay close attention to visibility and inheritance modifiers. Imagine that you are writing a library that you are going to share with the public, do not forget about `sealed`, `internal` and extension functions.

### Iterators

Iterators get invalidated if the underlying collection was modified after their creation not using them. Example:
```kotlin
val list = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
for (item in list) {
    println(item)
    list.removeLast()
}
```
This code will print 1 and then throw `ConcurrentModificationException`, because `for` loop creates an iterator, which is invalidated after an element is removed from the list. At the same time, code below works, and the list will be left empty as a result:
```kotlin
val list = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
val it = list.iterator()
for (item in it) {
    it.remove()
}
println(list) // []
```
To learn how to achieve this you can look through [AbstractList code](https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/java/util/AbstractList.java) and pay attention to `modCount` property.

### Entries, Keys and Values

Entries and other properties of `MutableMap` and `Map` are _views_ of the underlying collection. It means that they should not be a copy of the collection, but simply provide another way of access to the original collection. Example:
```kotlin
val simpleMap = mutableMapOf(1 to "a", 2 to "b")
val entries = simpleMap.entries
println(entries) // [1=a, 2=b], same as map
simpleMap[3] = "c"
println(entries) // [1=a, 2=b, 3=c], element is present in the entries set
entries.removeIf { it.value == "b" }
println(simpleMap) // {1=a, 3=c}, 2=b was removed from the map
entries.add(SOMETHING) // throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
```

### Null safety

Try to avoid the not-null assertion operator (`!!`). There are various ways to do that:
```kotlin
fun trueIfAllNotNull(value1: Type?, value2: Type?, value3: Type?): Boolean {
    if (value1 == null) {
        return false
    }
    // now value1 is smart-casted to not-null Type
    val notNullValue2 = value2 ?: return false
    value3?.let { // it here is not-null Type
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```

## Partial Solutions

You may have completed the `List` task, and have not implemented maps yet.
Or you may have completed `Map`, but not `MutableMap`.
In such cases you need to disable corresponding tests in order for the build to pass CI.
To do that, go to `projectDir/.github/workflows/HW3.yml`. 
There is a list of jobs: build, diktat and so on. 
You can comment out/delete `map`, `mutable-map` or `list` (the whole block, not just the name) if you have not done that part yet.

## Detekt and Diktat
To run detekt: `gradlew customDetekt`  
To run diktat: `gradlew diktatCheck`  
Or find corresponding Gradle tasks in IDEA's Gradle toolbar in 'Tasks > verification'.  
Reports of both detekt and diktat can be found as HTML files in '$projectDir/build/reports'.  
__Note:__ if you disagree with some diktat or detekt rule, you can suppress it and write down your reasoning in the PR. It is okay to sometimes bend the rules.
